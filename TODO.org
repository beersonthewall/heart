* Kernel
** Misc
*** TODO Where possible we should avoid using usize for pointers
** Vitual Memory
*** DONE Design kernel heap
*** DONE Frame Alloc trait shouldn't be in an architecture specific module
*** DONE FrameAlloc trait has a terrible name.
    Maybe FrameAllocatorAPI or something to make it different from the FrameAllocator
    struct when reading code?
    Renamed to FrameAllocatorAPI
*** DONE FrameAllocatorInner shouldn't assume pages from the bootstrap frame allocator will be mapped
*** TODO FrameAllocatorInner handles missing ranges in multiboot mmap
*** DONE Slab allocator should default to a best fit allocator if an allocation wants more memory than a slab can provide
*** TODO LinkedListHeap should merge nodes if possible to avoid fragmenting into too many (relatively) small nodes
*** TODO LinkedListHeap should correctly align pointers based on the layout
