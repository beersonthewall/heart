# Wizard Insane

## About

An x86_64 kernel in Rust. Built very slowly as I'm learning OS dev as I go.

## Setup

- Rust nightly toolchain
- qemu
- various system packages which I don't remember

## What's With The Name?

I hate naming projects so I put my name into [this](https://wutangnamefor.me/) and that's the result.
